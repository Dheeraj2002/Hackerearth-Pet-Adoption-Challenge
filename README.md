# Hackerearth-Pet-Adoption-Challenge

As the name of this repo suggests , it is a Machine Learning Challenge named ``` Pet Adoption``` hosted by [Hackerearth](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/) .

I had used the [Xgboost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) , [LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [CatBoost](https://catboost.ai/) algorithms combined them using [Voting Classifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.VotingClassifier.html) .
As ensemble methods reduce Overfittting somehow , the final algorithm had given much better results than individuals.

I finally ended up in Top 200 (182 rank) .
